# The game 

![](/md/duct1.png)

The game can be considered as a 2D platformer with a bit of Metroidvania feels.
As the player, you will play a small Duct Tape shopkeeper.

The Duct Tape is a core mechanic of the game, and it's what bound us with the jam theme.
The hero will use the tape to craft and join together all sort of items to help him during his journey.

One day the hero get a call from his granny, she wants to make a delicious cake, but sadly she is missing an egg for the receipt.

Luckily, the hero has an egg in this shop. This is the beginning of your journey toward granny's house.

On your way to granny's house, you will find all sort of blocked passages, and this is how your duct tape come handy. You will assemble a unique homemade tool to gain new abilities and overcome those challenges.

## The Stick

- Can be used to get rid of spider webs 
- Can be used on a surface to jump on the opposite direction 

## The Hammer

![](/md/duct7.png)

- Can be used to tear apart pine cones
- Swinging the heavy hammer will make your jump toward the direction of the swing 
  
## The Hammer-bow

![](/md/duct8.png)

- The bow shoots hammers that tear apart pine cones at mid-range
- When releasing the hammer after bending the bow, you will be ejected in the opposite direction of the hammer  

## The Sticky-hammer-bow

![](/md/duct9.png)

- Act the same as the Hammer-bow but now it sticks to walls on impact creating a platform you can then walk on allowing you to climb steep walls

## The Sticky-self-linked-hammer-bow

![](/md/duct10.png)

- Act the same as the Sticky-hammer-bow but since you are attached to the hammer with a rope, you will follow the hammer trajectory after shooting with the bow

## The Super-powerful-sticky-self-linked-hammer-bow

![](/md/duct11.png)

- Act the same as the Sticky-hammer-bow but shoot very, very far, maybe far enough to reach granny's house
