## Concept

In this application, you will talk with your acquaintance Sophie who is going to a party and give her your best advice to avoid that something bad happens to her.

You will be able to test your knowledge and learn more about the risks related to AIDS with a practical case.

## Game mode

You can find the application online at [https://hiv.codyadm.com](https://hiv.codyadm.com) 

The game is played by selecting one answer among several as if you were sending private messages to Sophie. 

At the end of your exchange with Sophie you get the list of points to improve during your next exchange with Sophie.

## Easter egg

You can also try to talk to Marc, a childhood friend of yours and Sophie's. He will help you unlock a new seduction technique for Sophie.
