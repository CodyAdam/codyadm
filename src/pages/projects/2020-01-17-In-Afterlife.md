# The Jam

This is my submission for the Weekly Game Jam 130 called **In Afterlife**.

The game jam theme was : "Dying is rewarded" 

# In Afterlife

The player is a slime with the power of becoming a ghost whenever he dies. While being a ghost you can move freely in the level and take others slimes body to revive.

Due to lack of time I didn't manage to implement sound / music in the game. Also, an undo button would be nice to have

# Controls

- Arrows -- to move (or WASD)
- R -- to retry
- T -- to warp to the levels hub
- Escape -- to leave the game (Be careful if you quit, progress will be reset)
