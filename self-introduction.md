Self-introduction of myself (Cody ADAM) applying for a software development internship


Hello there! My name is Cody Adam, and I'm applying for a software development internship. I'm a quick learner and have a passion for programming and software development. You can check out my portfolio website for experiences and projects (https://codyadm.com).

I'm proficient in a few programming languages, including Java, C, C++, and Python. I'm also very familiar with web technologies and frameworks. Furthermore, I participate in a lot of programming hackathon and challenges including competitive programming, which greatly improved my skills in problems solving and abstractly thinking to reach a goal.

I'm hardworking, creative, and highly motivated. I'm excited to learn new programming languages, frameworks, and technologies. I'm also eager to work with a team of experienced developers, and I'm confident that I can contribute to the success of any project.

Thank you for your time and consideration. I look forward to hearing from you.
